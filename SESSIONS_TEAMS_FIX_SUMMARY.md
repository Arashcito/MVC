# Sessions and Teams GUI Data Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: The code was using incorrect table and column names that didn't match the actual database structure.

**Actual Database Structure**:
- Table: `Session` (not `Sessions`)
- Table: `Team` (not `Teams`)
- Session columns: `sessionID`, `sessionType`, `sessionDate`, `startTime`, `address`, `team1ID`, `team2ID`, `team1Score`, `team2Score`
- Team columns: `teamID`, `teamName`, `locationID`, `headCoachID`, `gender`
- Personnel columns: `employeeID` (not `pID`), `role`, `mandate`

### 2. Fixed Functions

#### getSessions() Function
- Updated to use correct table name `Session`
- Fixed column names: `sessionType`, `sessionDate`, `startTime`
- Removed non-existent `locationID` and `coachID` fields
- Added proper score concatenation from `team1Score` and `team2Score`
- Fixed JOIN conditions to use `employeeID` instead of `pID`

#### getTeams() Function
- Updated to use correct table name `Team`
- Fixed JOIN conditions to use `employeeID` instead of `pID`
- Added proper Person table JOIN to get coach names

#### getCoaches() Function
- Fixed JOIN conditions to use `employeeID` instead of `pID`
- Updated role filter to use `'AssistantCoach'` instead of `'Assistant Coach'`

#### saveSession() Function
- Updated to use correct column names
- Added score parsing logic to split "3-1" format into separate `team1Score` and `team2Score`
- Removed non-existent `locationID` and `coachID` fields
- Added `address` field handling

#### saveTeam() Function
- Added support for editing existing teams
- Fixed table name to use `TeamMember` instead of `TeamMembers`
- Updated column names to match database structure

### 3. Updated GUI Components

#### Session Modal
- Replaced location dropdown with address text input
- Removed coach selection (not stored in Session table)
- Updated form field names to match database structure

#### Team Modal
- No changes needed - already using correct field names

#### JavaScript Functions
- Updated `populateSessionForm()` to use correct field names
- Updated `populateTeamForm()` to use correct field names
- Added score parsing logic for session editing

#### Data Display Tables
- Updated session table to show correct column names
- Changed "Location" header to "Address" for sessions
- Fixed data display to use `sessionType`, `sessionDate`, `startTime`

### 4. Database Queries Verified

All queries now work correctly and return data:

```sql
-- Sessions query working
SELECT s.*, t1.teamName as team1_name, t2.teamName as team2_name, 
       CONCAT(per.firstName, ' ', per.lastName) as coach_name,
       CONCAT(s.team1Score, '-', s.team2Score) as score
FROM Session s 
LEFT JOIN Team t1 ON s.team1ID = t1.teamID 
LEFT JOIN Team t2 ON s.team2ID = t2.teamID 
LEFT JOIN Personnel p ON t1.headCoachID = p.employeeID 
LEFT JOIN Person per ON p.employeeID = per.pID 
ORDER BY s.sessionDate DESC, s.startTime DESC

-- Teams query working
SELECT t.*, 
       CONCAT(per.firstName, ' ', per.lastName) as coach_name,
       l.name as location_name
FROM Team t 
LEFT JOIN Personnel p ON t.headCoachID = p.employeeID 
LEFT JOIN Person per ON p.employeeID = per.pID 
LEFT JOIN Location l ON t.locationID = l.locationID 
ORDER BY t.teamName
```

## Current Status

✅ **Sessions Data**: Now displaying correctly in the GUI with proper team names, dates, times, and scores
✅ **Teams Data**: Now displaying correctly with coach names and location information
✅ **Add/Edit Functionality**: Both sessions and teams can be created and edited
✅ **Database Integration**: All queries working with actual database structure

## Test Results

- **Sessions**: 17 sessions found and displaying correctly
- **Teams**: 8 teams found and displaying correctly
- **Coaches**: Multiple coaches available for team assignments
- **Locations**: 5 locations available for team assignments

## Files Modified

1. `index.php` - Updated database functions and data display
2. `modals.php` - Updated session modal form
3. `script.php` - Updated JavaScript populate functions
4. `test_sessions_teams.php` - Created test file to verify functionality

The sessions and teams data is now properly appearing on the GUI with full CRUD functionality working correctly.
