SELECT 
    loc.locationID,
    loc.address, 
    pai.city, 
    pai.province, 
    loc.postalCode, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(lp.phone SEPARATOR ', ') as phones,
    loc.webAddress, 
    loc.type, 
    loc.maxCapacity, 
    CONCAT(pn.firstName, ' ', pn.lastName) as managerName
FROM Location loc
JOIN PostalAreaInfo pai ON loc.postalCode = pai.postalCode
LEFT JOIN LocationPhone lp ON loc.locationID = lp.locationID
LEFT JOIN Personnel per ON loc.managerID = per.employeeID
LEFT JOIN Person pn ON per.employeeID = pn.pID
WHERE loc.locationID = ?
GROUP BY loc.locationID, loc.address, pai.city, pai.province, loc.postalCode, 
         loc.webAddress, loc.type, loc.maxCapacity, pn.firstName, pn.lastName;
```

### Step 3: Count Minor Members
```sql
SELECT COUNT(cm.memberID) as minorCount
FROM ClubMember cm
WHERE cm.memberType = 'Minor' AND cm.locationID = ?;
```
